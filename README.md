**Techniques for building machine learning and neural network models for NLP**

## What is this book about?
Natural Language Processing (NLP) allows you to take any sentence and identify patterns, special names, company names, and more. The second edition of Natural Language Processing with Java teaches you how to perform language analysis with the help of Java libraries, while constantly gaining insights from the outcomes.

This book covers the following exciting features: <First 5 What you'll learn points>
* Understand basic NLP tasks and how they relate to one another
* Discover and use the available tokenization engines
* Apply search techniques to find people, as well as things, within a document
* Construct solutions to identify parts of speech within sentences
* Use parsers to extract relationships between elements of a document

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
System.out.println(tagger.tagString("AFAIK she H8 cth!"));
System.out.println(tagger.tagString(
 "BTW had a GR8 tym at the party BBIAM."));
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
Natural Language Processing with Java is for you if you are a data analyst, data scientist, or machine learning engineer who wants to extract information from a language using Java. Knowledge of Java programming is needed, while a basic understanding of statistics will be useful but not mandatory.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-12).
